## Tips for advanced webpack configuration

If you use webpack (or another bundler) for your project and are already using a compiler for your JavaScript (like babel), you have the option of using odo component source files and compiling them with your project.

This has a couple benefits:

* No dependencies for odo are bundled with their dist files. For example, the `debounce` package is bundled in a couple odo components.
* Use the same babel preset for your app's code _and_ odo components. Maybe you're using [`babel-preset-env`](https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env) so that you can compile less.
* Less boilerplate code. Each odo component comes with webpack's [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) [wrapper](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/#output-librarytarget) so that it can work in multiple environments.

Use the `alias` object to map requests for odo components to their source files instead of dist files. This configuration is intended for webpack v2.

```js
// Webpack config
{
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@odopod/odo-carousel$': '@odopod/odo-carousel/src/carousel.js',
      '@odopod/odo-device$': '@odopod/odo-device/src/device.js',
      '@odopod/odo-draggable$': '@odopod/odo-draggable/src/draggable.js',
      '@odopod/odo-helpers$': '@odopod/odo-helpers/index.js',
      '@odopod/odo-pointer$': '@odopod/odo-pointer/src/pointer.js',
    },
  },
}
```

Don't `exclude` odo components from being compiled with babel.

```js
module: {
  rules: [
    {
      test: /\.js$/,
      exclude: /node_modules\/(?!@odopod\/odo-)/,
      loader: 'babel-loader',
    },
  }
]
```
