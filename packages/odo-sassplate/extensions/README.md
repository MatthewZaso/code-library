# Using JSON for SCSS Variables

By using JSON to store SCSS variables, we're able to access the variables directly within the style guide and dynamically create documentation pages using them. This saves a lot of mundane work, transposing font settings &amp; colors, and makes sure the docs are always up to date.

## Comments

You may add comments to the JSON file with `"__comment__"`. The style guide will ignore this key.
